# landuse-scene-datasets
Four urban land use scene datasets were created using VHR images from Chinese GF-2, Chinese GF-7, US Worldview, and French Pleiades satellites, in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Zhengzhou, and Wuhan cities, China. 

The datasets were used in the research, "Use of unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation for cross-domain land use classification from very high resolution remote sensing images". The detailed description and usage were given in the paper, which is undergoing peer review. At this moment, the datasets were only available on request.
